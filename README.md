# odin-recipes
Recipe website for The Odin Project Course

This is my first TOP Project. It aims to demonstrate the foundational
skills of writing HTML file and operating within the GIT/Github environment. In 
order to succeed I will have to use what was thaught in the course, to include
the terminal, VSCode, Github and GIT.


I will write recipes that I keep going back to on youtube. saving me time 
and data.


P.S. The lessons are good. but putting reps in is important. while GIT is 
simple in concept, it is not intuitive to use in practical situation at 
this point.
